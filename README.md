# EECS 376 Discussions

## About This Site

Welcome! This site is a curated collection of the interactive discussion activities I've helped design and run for [EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science](https://eecs376.org/) at the University of Michigan. Starting in Fall 2024, we introduced a new attendance incentive policy — attending a minimum number of discussion sections can earn you bonus points on your final grade, replacing a small portion of your exam score.

To make that policy meaningful, we reimagined discussion sections to be more interactive, collaborative, and engaging. Rather than mere PowerPoint presentations, we've adopted inquiry-based learning (IBL): students work in small groups through guided worksheets and activities that encourage exploration, discussion, and peer reasoning. Many of these activities are showcased here.

This shift reflects my own passion for teaching and learning — and my background in math education research, which focused on how to make abstract content engaging and inclusive in undergraduate settings.
