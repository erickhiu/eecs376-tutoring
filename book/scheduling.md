# Schedule a Session

I currently offer two modes of tutoring:

- **Individual** — $25 per person per hour  
- **Group** — $15 per person per hour (up to 5 people per session)  

Each session is **1 hour long**.  
Please make sure to book **at least 24 hours in advance**.

## How It Works

1. Choose your session type — Individual or Group. For group, please indicate the group size (max 5) and invite all members to the meeting using _Add guest_. 
2. Pick a time using the Calendly widget below.
3. Receive a confirmation email with payment details.
4. Complete payment to secure your slot.
5. Get the meeting link — once payment is confirmed, I’ll send you the meeting link and any prep materials.
