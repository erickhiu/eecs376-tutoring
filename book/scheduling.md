# Schedule a Session

I currently offer two modes of tutoring:

- **Individual** — $25 per person per hour  
- **Group** — $15 per person per hour (up to 5 people per group)  

Each session is **1 hour long**.  
Please make sure to book **at least 24 hours in advance**.  

## How It Works

1. Choose your session type: Individual or Group.
2. Pick a time that Eric is available.
3. Receive a confirmation email with payment details.
4. Complete payment to secure your slot.
5. Once payment is confirmed, I’ll send you the meeting link and any prep materials.

## Note for Group Sessions

- Please form your own group (up to 5 people). I do **not** provide group matching. You are responsible for finding your group members.
- Only one person should make the booking on behalf of the group.
- That same person is responsible for making the single payment for the entire group.
- When booking, indicate the group size and invite all members to the meeting using _Add Guest_.
