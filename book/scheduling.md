# Schedule a Session

I currently offer two modes of tutoring:

- **Individual** — $25 per person per hour  
- **Group** — $15 per person per hour (up to 5 people per session)  

Each session is **1 hour long**.  
Please make sure to book **at least 24 hours in advance**.

## How It Works

- Select whether you’d like an **Individual** or a **Group** session when booking.  
- Check my availability directly through the Calendly widget below.  
- After booking, you’ll receive a confirmation email with all the details.
