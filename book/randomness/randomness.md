# Randomness

This unit introduces randomness in computation, including how algorithms can benefit from randomness and how to analyze randomized algorithms.

Activities in this unit:

- **Randomized Approximation**: [*Colorful Edges*](./colorful-edge/colorful-edge.md)  
- **Randomized Algorithms**: [*Unbiased Die*](./unbiased-die/unbiased-die.ipynb)
