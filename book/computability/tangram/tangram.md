# TangraM

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, students should be able to:
1. Construct complex Turing machines by composing simple subroutines.
2. Understand how subroutine composition can realize desired computational properties.
3. Feeling comfortable with the "creating machines within machines" Turing reduction problems. 

## üß∞ Materials / Props
- [Tangram set](./Tangram.pdf): A Turing machine skeleton and a collection of subroutines. Winter 25 version: 
    ```
    function M'(w):
      if condition X is true then
        call [ ? ]
      else
        call [ ? ]
    ```
    <table>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine A</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function A(a):
      accept</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine B</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function B(b):
      reject</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine C</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function C(c):
      loop</code></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine D</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function D(d):
      if d = Œµ then
        accept
      else
        reject</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine E</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function E(e):
      if e ‚àà {3, 7, 6} then
        loop
      else
        reject</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td style="padding: 20px;"><strong>Subroutine F</strong><br>
          <pre><code>function F(f):
      if 1 = 0 then
        reject
      else
        accept</code></pre>

## üïπÔ∏è Activity Walkthrough

**Time**: 8-10 minutes

**Setup**:
1. Introduce the TangraM analogy: just like geometric tangrams form complex shapes from simple pieces, we‚Äôre building a Turing machine by combining simple subroutines.
2. Explain that students will pick subroutines (from functions A‚ÄìF) to fill in each block in the skeleton so that the machine M‚Ä≤ exhibits the required behavior.

    > **Exercise 1: Accept All vs Not Accept All**
    > - If condition X is true, then M' accepts all inputs.
    > - If condition X is false, then M' does not accept all inputs.
    
    > **Exercise 2: Accept Finite vs. Infinite Inputs**
    > - If condition X is true, then M' accepts a finite number of inputs.
    > - If condition X is false, then M' accepts an infinite number of inputs. 


**üí°Facilitating Tips**:
- Remind students that multiple solutions exist, and encourage them to come out with different combinations that work. 
- Ask them to describe why their chosen subroutines meet the ‚Äúaccept all‚Äù or ‚Äúaccept infinitely many‚Äù criteria.

## üìò Instructor's Solution

1. Use any of `A` or `F` for the if case (always accept); use any of `B`, `C`, `D`, or `E` for the else case (does not always accept). 
2. Use any of `B`, `C`, `E` (accepts no inputs which is finite) or `D` (accepts one input) for the if case; use any of `A` or `F` for the else case (accepts infinitely many inputs). 

## üìù Eric's Notes
- First ran in Winter 2025. Conceptually strong and pairs well with the discussion on Turing reductions.
- Consider enhancing the experience with:
    - Physical cards for subroutines A‚ÄìF, letting students physically "build" M'.
    - A drag-and-drop digital interface, similar to EECS 280 online exams, where students compose and test logic combinations.
- The current subroutines are functional but a bit plain‚Äîfuture iterations could include more creative or surprising behaviors (e.g., subroutines with stateful branching or multiple acceptance paths).
