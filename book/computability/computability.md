# Computability

In this unit, we explore the foundations of computability theory—what problems can (and can’t) be solved by computational models. We begin with finite automata and regular languages, then move to the power of Turing machines, and finally investigate the limits of computation through undecidability and Turing reductions.

Activities in this unit:

- **DFA**: [*DFA Pictionary Challenge*](dfa/dfa.md)
- **Turing Machines**: [*Turing Machines Playground*](tm/tm.md)
- **Turing Reductions**: [*TangraM*](tangram/tangram.md)
