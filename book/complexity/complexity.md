# Complexity

In this unit, we study the complexity classes P and NP, discuss NP-hardness and NP-completeness, study problems are unlikely to be efficiently solvable, and how to apply approximations to such problems.

Activities in this unit:

- **NP-hardness and NP-completeness**: [Super Mario Bros.](./mario/mario.md)
- **Approximation Algorithms**: [Runtime vs. Accuracy](./tradeoff/tradeoff.md)


Additional worksheets:

- [Cook Levin Theorem Building Blocks](./others/clt.md)
