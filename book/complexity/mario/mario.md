# Super Mario Bros. 
_This is not a classroom activty (yet) per se, but could potentially be turned into one._

## 🧠 Background & Context

This content is based on the NP-hardness reduction from 3SAT to Super Mario Bros., adapted from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895). I’ve been presenting and demoing it as a mini-presentation, but there’s definitely potential to adapt it into a hands-on classroom activity. I also documented the content on [this site](https://erickhiu.github.io/mario-npc/) for future reference and sharing.

## 📝 Eric's Notes
- I first presented it during in Fall 2024 for Halloween, and my students absolutely loved it. I continued presenting it in Winter 2025 for a (belated) Mario day celebration. 
- Some ideas for classroom activity adaptation: Consider printing the gadgets for students to physically assemble (most importantly, connecting the gadgets). This might make the NP-hardness proof more tactile and memorable.
